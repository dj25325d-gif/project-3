# 🎓 Student Data Organizer (Python)

A **menu-driven Python console application** that allows users to manage student records efficiently.  
This project demonstrates the use of **core Python data structures** such as dictionaries, tuples, sets, and lists.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Data Organizer enables users to:

- Add new student records
- Display all stored students
- Update student details
- Delete student records
- Display all unique subjects offered
- Exit the program safely with input validation

All operations are performed through a **command-line menu system**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts & Data Structures Used

- **Dictionary (`dict`)** – stores all student records
- **Tuple (`tuple`)** – used as a composite key (`Student ID`, `Date of Birth`)
- **Set (`set`)** – ensures unique subjects per student
- **List (`list`)** – used for formatted output
- **Loops & Conditionals** – menu-driven program flow
